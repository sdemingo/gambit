# Gambit

Chess board in your terminal. All this work are inspired and based in the original [gambit](https://github.com/maaslalani/gambit) from [Maas Lalani](https://github.com/maaslalani). 

I'm take it and build [gambitsrv](https://github.com/sdemingo/gambitsrv). A simple server in Go to manage games between human players.

### Move

There are two ways to move in `gambit`:

* Type out the square the piece you want to move is on, then type out the square to which you want to move the piece.
* With the mouse, click on the target piece and target square.

### Play

You can play a game by running:

```
gambit
```

You can press <kbd>ctrl+f</kbd> to flip the board to give a better perspective
for the second player.
